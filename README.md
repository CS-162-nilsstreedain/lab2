# Getting Practice with Classes
In order to get credit for the lab, you need to be checked off by the end of lab. You can earn up to half of the points for lab work completed outside of lab time, but you must finish before the next lab. For extenuating circumstances, contact your lab TAs and the instructor.

For this lab we would like to create the basics for some of the classes used in Program 1.

## (5 pts) Pokemon Class
Design and create the .h and .cpp files with accessors, mutators, and constructors for a Pokemon class. Pokemon have the following properties: dex number, name, type, and moves. Each Pokemon will have 4 moves.

## (5 pts) Pokedex Class
Design and create the .h and .cpp files with accessors, mutators, and constructors for a Pokedex class. A Pokedex is made up of three properties: the name of the trainer who owns it, the number of Pokemon, and a dynamic array of Pokemon. The Pokedex class should also have a function for adding new Pokemon data to it. (Links to an external site.)

## (10 pts) Implementation
Now, create a driver.cpp file that creates a Pokedex, sets some Pokemon data, and prints it out. For the data, feel free to make up random values, or use some of the actual info from https://pokedex.org/ (Links to an external site.)

*Remember, you  will not receive lab credit if you do not get checked off by the TA before leaving each lab. Once you have a zero on a lab, then it cannot be changed because we have no way of knowing if you were there or not!*
